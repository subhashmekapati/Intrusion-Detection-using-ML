# Intrusion-Detection-using-ML
Objective: Develop an accurate machine learning algorithm to detect network attacks. Dataset includes normal activities and attacks (DoS, exploits, worms). Algorithms tested: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, XGBoost, ANN. Goal: Enhance network security through effective intrusion detection.
